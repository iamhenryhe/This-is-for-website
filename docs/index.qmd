## [My project](myproject.html)

### Design and Implementation of a Public Library Management Database System

### October 2023 – November 2023

•Expert in Large Dataset Management: Demonstrated excellence in handling vast datasets of books and user information, ensuring robust system stability and impeccable data integrity, pivotal in supporting data-driven decisions.

•Query: I improved system performance by optimizing SQL queries, such as using appropriate indexing and query rewriting techniques to speed up queries and reduce system load.

•Real-world understanding of data management applications: I apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations to ensure that database systems meet real-world business requirements and operational challenges.

### Optimizing Public-Sector Investment Decisions through Goal Programming: A Multi-Objective Approach
### September 2023 – December 2023
•Linear Algebra: Skillfully employed the Simplex Method to optimize project workflows, achieving a huge increase in operational efficiency and significantly reducing resource allocation errors in linear programming tasks.

•Python Programming: Developed advanced Python algorithms that streamlined the investment project's decision-making process, enhancing efficiency and delivering optimal financial solutions.

•Lingo software application: I used Lingo for dynamic sensitivity analysis, which helps in evaluating the impact of changes in decision variables on the final outcome, thus enhancing the usefulness and flexibility of the model.
